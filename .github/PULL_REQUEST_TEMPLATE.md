## Description

*Enter the description for changes you have made for this PR below*
In the email_parser python file, I wrote a regular expression pattern that is used to
search through an email address and extract the username part and the domain name part
of the email address. I enabled the parse function to save the extracted information into
a dictionary.
Also, in the test_email_parser python file, i created test cases for the program(specifically
for the parse function) so as to check if its output is correct.

## General Notes

*Add any other information that you think the reviewer should have while reviewing below*
I created the tests based on the constraints provided in the task(depending on the symbol,
alphabets or numbers etc)
